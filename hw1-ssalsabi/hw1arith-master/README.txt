Assignment 1 - Arith
How to Run:
  In order to run my program manually use the command python3 arith.py then type in your input. Please use my harness.bash as well in order to run the test script, it is modified to use the
  python3 arith.py command. Pyinstaller would not download into my unix environment, so I was not able to create an executable. The TA agreed to these modifications. 
Who worked on it:
  On this homework, I worked independently over 8 hours.
Citation Code:
  I used a 3rd party library called Lex-Yacc at this site https://www.dabeaz.com/ply/ in order to build my lexar and parser. I also used extensive documentation from that site to help me
  understand how to set there lexar and parser rules. I also used this https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tree-traversals-inorder-preorder-and-postorder/ to help better understand postorder
  traversal for a binary tree modifying it for my ast implementation. I also used https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part7/ to better understand how to build parsers, interperters, and lexars
  and why they are needed.
