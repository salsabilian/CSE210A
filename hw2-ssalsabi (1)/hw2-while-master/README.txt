Assignment 2 - While
How to Run:
  in order to run my program manually use the command python3 while.py then type in your input. Please use my harness.bash as well in order to run the test script, it is 
modified to use the python3 while.py command. Pyinstaller would not download into my unix environment, so I was not able to create an executable. The TA agreed to these 
modifications.
Who worked on it:
  On this homework, I worked independently over 14 hours.
Citation Code:
  I used a 3rd party library called Lex-Yacc at this site https://www.dabeaz.com/ply/ in order to build my lexar and parser. I also used extensive documentation from that 
site to help me understand how to set there lexar and parser rules.
